1. Speed: Tachyon runs approximately 10 times faster than [Rapidsnark]! The [benchmark] was conducted using [sha256_512.circom] with a degree of 2ยนโถ.
2. Seamless Workflow: Tachyon doesn't require you to run any additional programs just to generate a circom proof. No need for [snarkjs] for witness file generation.
3. Flexible Witness Handling: With Tachyon, you can modify the witness directly in your program. No need to create a separate JSON file with [snarkjs].
4. Integrated Build System: Tachyon seamlessly integrates circom compilation into the build system, specifically bazel. When you make changes to a circom file, it's compiled accordingly and built in parallel, ensuring a safe and efficient process.
5. Field Support: Tachyon isn't limited to bn128; it easily supports all fields!
6. Gpu Support: Both Tachyon and [Orbiter-Finance/Rapidsnark] support MSM / NTT using [icicle].

## How to build

Go to [prerequisites](../../docs/how_to_use/how_to_build.md#Prerequisites) and follow the instructions.

### Linux with CUDA

```shell
bazel build --@kroma_network_tachyon//:has_openmp -c opt --config linux --config cuda //:prover_main
```

### Linux

```shell
bazel build --@kroma_network_tachyon//:has_openmp -c opt --config linux //:prover_main
```

### MacOS arm64

```shell
bazel build --@kroma_network_tachyon//:has_openmp -c opt --config macos_arm64 //:prover_main
```

### MacOS x64

```shell
bazel build --@kroma_network_tachyon//:has_openmp -c opt --config macos_x86_64 //:prover_main
```

## How to run

```shell
bazel-bin/prover_main -h
Usage:

bazel-bin/prover_main zkey wtns proof public [OPTIONS]

Positional arguments:

zkey                The path to zkey file
wtns                The path to wtns file
proof               The path to proof json
public              The path to public json
n                   The number of times to run the proof generation

Optional arguments:

--curve             The curve type among ('bn254', bls12_381'), by default 'bn254'
--no_zk             Create proof without zk. By default zk is enabled. Use this flag in case you want to compare the proof with rapidsnark.
--no_use_mmap       Create proof not using mmap(2). By default, mmap(2) is enabled, memory mapped file offers faster proof generation at the cost of increased memory usage. Use this flag if you want to use less memory.
--verify            Verify the proof. By default verify is disabled. Use this flag to verify the proof with the public inputs.
-n, --num_runs      The number of times to run the proof generation
--disable_fast_twiddles_mode
                    Disables fast twiddle mode on Icicle NTT domain initialization.
```
